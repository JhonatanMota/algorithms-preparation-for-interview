# Twin challenge
A twin of a word is a word written with the same letters (case insensitive) but not necessarily in the same order.

For example `Silent` is a twin of `Listen`.

The `isTwin(a,b)` method should return `true` if `b` is the twin of `a` and `false` otherwise, a and b are two non-null strings.

**Write the body of the 'isTwin(a,b)' method.**
